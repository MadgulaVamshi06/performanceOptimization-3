The component uses the useState hook to manage state for the timer (timer), list of posts (posts), and the input fields for creating a new post (postInput).
The timer state is updated using the setTimer function inside a useEffect hook to create a timer that increments every second.
The posts state holds an array of post objects.
The postInput state holds the data for the new post being created.
The handleChange function updates the postInput state as the user types in the input fields.
The handleSubmit function is called when the user clicks the "Add Post" button, adding a new post to the posts array and resetting the postInput state.
The useMemo hook is used to memoize the posts array, preventing unnecessary re-renders when the posts state changes.
The Post1 component is imported and rendered for each post in the posts array. It receives props including the post object and the setPosts function to update the list of posts.
